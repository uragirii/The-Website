# The Website

This is my Personal Porfolio-Website to showcase my talent in CSS, React and Web Development along with my other projects.

Right now almost all of the functions are working good. Site is now optimized for mobile users! My next focus is to make load times faster and add animations.

## The Details

The behind-the-scenes stuff and other things.

### Color Palette

At first I decided to make a dark mode toggle but I love Dark mode and decided to set it as default mode of the website.

The background is dark blue-black color : `#0D0416` 

The foreground is a bright pinkish color and I slightly mixed my background to make it darker : `#D50056`

Right now I'm using a Perfect White for Headings and slight Off White(`#F4F1F1`) for secondary. I intend to change it in the future.

Now I've also added favicon and improved all the project details.


### Technical Stuff

I used `React JS` to make the website and then used Firebase Hosting to Host the website. But along with `React JS` following things have significantly helped in the process.

- `GSAP` and `useIntersection` : The animations on scoll is provided using GSAP 3.0 and using a custom hook : `useIntersection`. If you want to know what `useIntersection` is read about [Intersection Observer API on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
- Figma : I can't stress this enough but using Figma for designing the website beforehand significantly reduced my developement time. I will share Figma Project for this website in future. Check out Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/).
- Nodemailer : I'm using nodemailer to send emails for contacting me. It has really reduced my work.
- Helpful Community : I just love programming community on Reddit, StackOverflow, Medium, YouTube etc. There numerous tutorials and articles have helped in solving made bugs.

### Future Plans

I'm deciding to name all the alpha versions to spell `KONOHA`, birthplace of Naruto. So, in all, all there would be atmost 6 versions. Current Version is `v0.4alphaN`. Website now designed for mobile users also. Now, I've to include animations and optimizations.

After running many tests I've decided to reduce the Image sizes and other things. I will keep you posted.
